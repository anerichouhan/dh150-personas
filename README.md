# UX Storytelling

Storytelling is an important part of User Experience as it fosters empathy and provides clarity on the jounrey a user goes through.
I consolidated 5 of my user interviews into personas, empathy maps, scenarios, and journey maps to communicate the insights I gained through user research.

## Features
1. News of the Day to provide a snapshot of relevant news
2. Categorical search to easily find and filter content 
3. Personal Library to save articles of interest

**Scenario for Miguel**


Miguel is a busy man whose weekdays are very hectic. He wakes up one Tuesday morning, gets dressed for work and prepares some breakfast before heading out. While he's enjoying an omlet at home, Miguel feels the desire to catch up on some news headlines and learn about what people are talking about in the tech and business world. He wants to catch up on the latest news so that he can have some engaging conversations with his peers at work. His email inbox is full of newsletters on different pieces of information and he does not know what specific topic he should catch up on. Miguel opens up the Techcrunch website to find the latest information on what's going on. When he opens up the homepage, he sees a neatly categorized section called 'News of the day' that contains snippets of the most important tech and business headlines. Miguel gets an undersatnding into relevant information that people are talking about. He feels stimulated by the content he reads and is excited to go into work and have thought provoking conversations about tech and business with his peers!

**Scenario for Samantha**

Samantha is a creative researcher who loves deep diving into interesting tech topics and writing about them. She wants to learn new things and become a topic expert in different topics each month. For the month of May, she has decided to learn and write about Artificial Intelligence. To learn and write, she needs information about the fundamentals of AI, trends in the market, products and innovation, and ethics in the field. Samantha first Google searches for artificial intelligence. She is overwhelmed and frustrated by the content and wants an easy way to narrow her search and get more directed information. She ends up spending a lot time searching and get annoyed as a result. Finally, Samantha realizes that the Techcrunch has the most relevant information for her. She heads on over to the website and searches for articles on Artificial Intelligence. She is able to filter her search by length of the article, date, author etc. All the information is organized in systematic categories and Samantha is able to quickly find good research information. Samantha feels satisfied, productive and happy that she made progress in her research!
