# UX Storytelling

Storytelling is an important part of User Experience as it fosters empathy and provides clarity on the jounrey a user goes through.
I consolidated 5 of my user interviews into personas, empathy maps, scenarios, and journey maps to communicate the insights I gained through user research.

**Scenario for Miguel**


Miguel is a busy man whose weekdays are very hectic. He wakes up one Tuesday morning, gets dressed for work and prepares some breakfast before heading out. While he's enjoying an omlet at home, Miguel feels the desire to catch up on some news headlines and learn about what people are talking about in the tech and business world. He wants to catch up on the latest news so that he can have some engaging conversations with his peers at work. His email inbox is full of newsletters on different pieces of information and he does not know what specific topic he should catch up on. Miguel opens up the Techcrunch website to find the latest information on what's going on. When he opens up the homepage, he sees a neatly categorized section called 'News of the day' that contains snippets of the most important tech and business headlines. Miguel gets an undersatnding into relevant information that people are talking about. He feels stimulated by the content he reads and is excited to go into work and have thought provoking conversations about tech and business with his peers!
